# Adult Family Home Website Template Workflow

## Goal

Develop a Claude template system for creating websites for different adult family homes.

## Initial Workflow

1. Collect sample web designs and images for inspiration
2. Create prompts to extract styles from preferred designs
3. Generate a simple homepage using Claude
4. Break down the page into reusable components
5. Develop styling approach and create stylesheet

Additionally, I need to research Claude's custom/slash commands for workflow optimization.
